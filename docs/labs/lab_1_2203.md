# Task 1
- Create your first SSH RSA key pair using two lengths `2048` and `4096` bits. Compare the generated files and play around with the parameters of openssh.
- Rename each key pair to task1_size_in_bits:
    - Example: task1_2048 and task1_2048.pub

# Task 2
- Generate another SSH RSA key pair, but this time it is required to have a passphrase set for your key and it must be `4096` in size or larger.
- Rename the key pair generated in this task to `task2_4096` and `task2_4096.pub` , respectively.
