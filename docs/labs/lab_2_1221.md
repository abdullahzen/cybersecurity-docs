# Prerequisite Steps
1. Download and install the npcap library (you only need to install it, you don't need to run it): [download](https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.76.exe)
1. Download and install Wireshark packet capture software: [download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
> If you install the npcap library after Wireshark, please restart wireshark afterwards


# Task 1

1. While wirshark **is capturing**, open your browser and go to: [http://www.altoromutual.com/](http://www.altoromutual.com/)

1. Click on "Sign in" or "Online Banking Login"

1. Enter your first name as a username and any random password (do NOT put a password that you usually use, because we do not know if we can trust this website.)
> It's normal to get an error in Step 6 for the login information entered. We're not interested in the login itself. The purpose of this is to sniff the packets.

1. Go back to the wireshark window and click on the red square at the top to stop capturing the packets:

1. In the filter section, type: `frame contains "login"` to filter for the login packets.

1. Locate the packet that is responsible for sending the login request to altormutual.com and go through the details of the packet. We are looking for the password in the packet.

1. Take a screenshot of the packet showing the password in the screenshot and save it for submission.

1. Exit wireshark and click on "Save" the captured packets when prompted. Save it in a location you can retrieve later for submission.
